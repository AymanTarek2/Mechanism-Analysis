## Project Workflow

### 1. **Motion Simulation**
   - **Tool Used**: [Linkage](http://www.rectorsquid.com/linkage.html)
   - Designed and simulated the motion of the linkage to ensure the mechanism can achieve continuous rotation without interference or locking.

### 2. **Analytical Analysis**
   - Derived the mathematical equations governing the mechanism's motion.
   - Developed analytical models for position, velocity, and acceleration based on the equations.

### 3. **MATLAB Code Implementation**
   - Implemented the analytical equations in MATLAB.
   - Simulated the mechanism's behavior for every input angle (Î¸_in) of the rotating motor.
   - Generated detailed plots for all the outputs in each stage of the analysis.

### 4. **Graphical Analysis**
   - Performed a graphical analysis at a specific input angle.
   - Compared results from the graphical analysis with those from the MATLAB simulation for validation.

## Features

- **Mechanism Validation**: Ensured continuous rotation using simulation.
- **Detailed Analysis**:
  - Analytical equations for the mechanism's kinematics.
  - MATLAB plots for better visualization and understanding.
- **Cross-Verification**: Compared analytical and graphical results to confirm accuracy.

## Results
